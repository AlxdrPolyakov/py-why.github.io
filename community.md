## Community

PyWhy also has a [Discord](https://discord.gg/cSBGb3vsZb), which serves as a space for like-minded casual machine learning researchers and practitioners of all experience levels to come together to ask and answer questions, discuss new features, and share ideas.

We invite you to join us at regular office hours and community calls in the Discord.

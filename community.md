## Community

PyWhy also has a [Discord](https://discord.gg/cSBGb3vsZb), which serves as a space for like-minded casual machine learning researchers and practitioners of all experience levels to come together to ask and answer questions, discuss new features, and share ideas.

PyWhy meetings are held every Monday at 8am PT/11am ET, alternating biweekly between Office Hours and PyWhy Community Discussions. For latest schedule and joining details, check [Discord](https://discord.gg/cSBGb3vsZb).

  An introduction to EconML,a project under Microsoft ALICE team effort to direct Artificial Intelligence towards economic decision making. We are building tools that combine state-of-the-art machine learning with econometrics – the measurement of economic systems — in order to bring automation to economic decision making. The heart of this project is a striving to measure causation: if you want to understand or make policy decisions in a complex economy, you need to know why the system moves the way it does.
summary: >-
  EconML is a Python package that applies the power of machine learning techniques to estimate individualized causal responses from observational or experimental data. The suite of estimation methods provided in EconML represents the latest advances in causal machine learning. By incorporating individual machine learning steps into interpretable causal models, these methods improve the reliability of what-if predictions and make causal analysis quicker and easier for a broad set of users.

  An introduction to EconML,a project under Microsoft ALICE team effort to direct Artificial Intelligence towards economic decision making. We are building tools that combine state-of-the-art machine learning with econometrics – the measurement of economic systems — in order to bring automation to economic decision making. The heart of this project is a striving to measure causation: if you want to understand or make policy decisions in a complex economy, you need to know why the system moves the way it does.
summary: >-
  EconML is a Python package that applies the power of machine learning techniques to estimate individualized causal responses from observational or experimental data. The suite of estimation methods provided in EconML represents the latest advances in causal machine learning. By incorporating individual machine learning steps into interpretable causal models, these methods improve the reliability of what-if predictions and make causal analysis quicker and easier for a broad set of users.

title: DoWhy | An end-to-end library for causal inference

  An introduction to DoWhy, a Python library for causal inference that supports explicit modeling and testing of causal assumptions. 
summary: >-
  Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, <strong>“DoWhy” is a Python library that aims to spark causal 
  thinking and analysis.</strong> DoWhy provides a principled four-step interface for causal inference that focuses on 
  explicitly modeling causal assumptions and validating them as much as possible. The key feature of DoWhy is its state-of-the-art 
  refutation API that can automatically test causal assumptions for any estimation method, thus making inference more robust and 
  accessible to non-experts. DoWhy supports estimation of the average causal effect for backdoor, frontdoor, instrumental variable 
  and other identification methods, and estimation of the conditional effect (CATE) through an integration with the EconML library.

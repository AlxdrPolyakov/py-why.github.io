title: Machine Learning Based Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
description: "The EconML package implements recent techniques in the literature at the intersection of econometrics and machine learning that tackle the problem of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via machine learning based approaches. These novel methods offer large flexibility in modeling the effect heterogeneity (via techniques such as random forests, boosting, lasso and neural nets), while at the same time leverage techniques from causal inference and econometrics to preserve the causal interpretation of the learned model and many times also offer statistical validity via the construction of valid confidence intervals."

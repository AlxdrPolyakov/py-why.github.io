summary: >-
  This tutorial covers some of the fundamental concepts and ideas of causal AI using the DoWhy library in Python. Causal inference is quite different 
  conceptually from standard machine learning, so most people will start out with limited background knowledge. However, basic knowledge of regression
  analysis and statistical modeling will be helpful for following along. By Paul HÃ¼nermund and Jermain Kaminski

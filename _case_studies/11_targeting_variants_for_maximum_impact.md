  This tutorial provides an introduction to causal AI using the CausalTune library in Python. It shows a practical example and the use of the ERUPT metric. It also shows how to use ERUPT to evaluate previous experiments, as well as how to evaluate the potential effect of a future experiment with different assignments using a real business example.
